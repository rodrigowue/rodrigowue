I am [Rodrigo](https://inf.ufrgs.br/~rnwuerdig/) - a Ph.D. student in microelectronics at UFRGS who loves to learn how everything works. I'm a creative thinker who loves to explore different fields and share his ideas. I've worked in innovative startups, gaining valuable experience in multicultural and fast-paced environments. My main interests include low-power and mixed-signal circuits, FPGAs, ASIC, and hardware security. 

As an active member of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society and the Electron Devices Society, I am committed to advancing the field of microelectronics.
